Go Baby Go Landers Project
Overview
The Go Baby Go Lander project is part of an initiative to design and develop a series of adaptive vehicles aimed at providing adaptive play experiences for children with mobility challenges. 
The primary goal is to modify existing ride-on cars to allow for easy control and customized functionality, empowering children with limited mobility to explore and engage with their environment more independently.

This repository contains the code and hardware design for the various ride-on modifications, including motor control, joystick interface, ramp control, and potential integration of advanced features such as parallel drive systems and adaptive steering mechanisms.

Features
Arcade-Style Drive System: The project uses joystick-controlled arcade-style drive logic, allowing the vehicle to be controlled with precise forward/backward and turning inputs.

Ramp Control: Smooth acceleration and deceleration mechanics are incorporated to ensure a responsive yet safe experience for the user.

4-Wheel Drive Support: Plans to modify the drivetrain to support a 4-wheel drive configuration, enhancing the maneuverability and stability of the ride-on vehicle - This is platform dependent.  

Adaptation for Accessibility: The modifications are designed with accessibility in mind, enabling children with mobility challenges to operate the vehicle independently.

Installation
Requirements:
Arduino IDE: Download and install the Arduino IDE.

Arduino Board: An Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno) for controlling the vehicle's motor systems and sensors - or ESP32

Motor Drivers/Controllers: Depending on your vehicle configuration, you may need motor drivers or servos (e.g., REV Spark Mini Motor Controllers, ESCs etc...).

Additional Hardware: Joysticks, linear actuators, servos for steering, and any other necessary components for the drivetrain.

Setup:
Clone or download this repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/shartpence/GoBabyGo-Lander.git
Open the project in the Arduino IDE.

Connect your Arduino board to the computer via USB.

Select the correct board and port under Tools > Board and Port.

Upload the code to your board by clicking the Upload button in the Arduino IDE.

Wiring:
Refer to the hardware design files (if available) for detailed instructions on wiring your motor controllers, servos, and other components to the Arduino board.

Usage
Driving the Vehicle:
Once the code is uploaded, you can control the vehicle using a joystick interface. The arcade-style controls allow for easy forward, backward, and turning actions.

Forward/Backward Movement: The Y-axis on the joystick controls forward and backward movement.

Turning: The X-axis on the joystick controls turning (left/right).

The system also includes ramp control for smooth acceleration and deceleration, ensuring a more comfortable driving experience for users.

Advanced Features (Future Plans):
4-Wheel Drive Ride Ons: Modify the drivetrain to support 4-wheel drive, increasing stability and control.

Adaptive Steering: Implement a parallelogram-style steering mechanism, potentially using large servos or linear actuators for more precise control.
